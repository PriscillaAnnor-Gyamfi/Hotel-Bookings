<h1>Hotel Bookings Project</h1>



<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Understanding and Improving Hotel Booking Processes:
Despite the significance of hotel bookings in the hospitality industry, challenges persist in optimizing booking procedures to enhance efficiency and guest satisfaction. This project aims to investigate factors influencing hotel bookings, such as hotel type, booking patterns, guest demographics, and cancellation rates, to identify opportunities for streamlining the booking process and improving overall guest experiences. By leveraging data-driven insights, this study seeks to address key issues and implement strategies that enhance booking procedures and maximize hotel revenue.



<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Hotel Type:  The City hotel receives the highest patronage, totaling 79,330 bookings, surpassing the Resort hotel. However, City hotels also experienced the highest number of cancellations compared to the 
     Resort hotel.</b>
- <b>Peak Booking Periods:August emerges as the peak booking period with 13,877 bookings, followed by July and May. These months coincide with the summer season, a time when vacation travel is prevalent. </b>
- <b>Demographic Preferences:Approximately 28.6% of all guests originated from Portugal, followed by Great Britain, France, Spain, and Germany. This suggests that the majority of hotel guests hail from European 
     countries.</b>
- <b>Market Segments/Booking channels: Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) accounted for 47.3% of total bookings, amounting to 56,477 reservations. </b>
- <b>Highest ADR (Average Daily Rate): Daniel Walter from Portugal recorded the highest Average Daily Rate of $5,400 at a City hotel, without eligibility for a refund.</b>
- <b>Cancellation Rates: The absence of deposits for most bookings contributed to a significant number of cancellations. Deposits serve as a commitment indicator for guests to honor their reservations.</b>
- <b>Customer Retention: Repeated guests comprise only 3.19% of total bookings, indicating that the majority of reservations are made by first-time guests or customers.</b>
 
 


<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Manhattan Neighborhood Group: With the highest number of listings (21,661), representing 44% of the total listings in the dataset, investing in properties in Manhattan neighborhoods could offer a significant market opportunity. Consider focusing on areas within Manhattan to maximize potential returns.Manhattan neighbourhood group is shown to have the highest listing of 21,661 signifying 44% of the entire 47,431 listings recorded in the dataset</b>
- <b>Brooklyn - Williamsburg: The neighborhood of Williamsburg in the Brooklyn neighborhood group generated the highest revenue ($12,389,011). This indicates a strong demand for accommodations in this area. Consider exploring investment opportunities in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to capitalize on its revenue-generating potential.</b>
- <b>Preferred Room Type - Entire Home/Apt: The most preferred room type among Airbnb guests was the entire home/apartment. Tailoring listings to offer entire homes or apartments could attract more bookings and potentially increase revenue. Ensure that properties listed offer amenities and features that align with the preferences of guests seeking entire home/apartment accommodations.</b>

<b>In summary, based on the findings, data-driven recommendations include focusing on investing in Manhattan neighborhoods, particularly those with high listing counts, exploring investment opportunities in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and prioritizing the listing of entire home/apartment accommodations to cater to guest preferences and maximize revenue potential.<b>
