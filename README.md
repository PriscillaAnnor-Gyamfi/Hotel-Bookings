<h1>Hotel Bookings Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is about studying how hotels are booked by guests considering the duration (date or time), place or country of origin the ratio of repeated guests to new guests and how insights can be drawn out of the data and possible recommendations given to enhance the business using the data provided. I used libraries like pandas for reading in the dataset from excel source, numpy for data wrangling and seaborn and matplotlib.plt for generating graphs. The dataset has 119,390 rows and 36 columns. During this project, I learned how to import and use libraries necessary for handling data cleaning, manipulation and generation of graphical representation of data to better understand trends and derive great insights to help come up with data-driven recommendations on strategies for retaining guests.
