<h1>Hotel Bookings Project</h1>



<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Understanding and Improving Hotel Booking Processes:
Despite the significance of hotel bookings in the hospitality industry, challenges persist in optimizing booking procedures to enhance efficiency and guest satisfaction. This project aims to investigate factors influencing hotel bookings, such as booking patterns, guest demographics, and cancellation rates, to identify opportunities for streamlining the booking process and improving overall guest experiences. By leveraging data-driven insights, this study seeks to address key issues and implement strategies that enhance booking procedures and maximize hotel revenue.



<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Peak Booking Periods: August has the peak booking period with a total 13,877 bookings followed by July and May. We can attribute these specific months to the fact that they make up the summer season and 
     people travel a lot for vacation during the summer. </b>
- <b>Demographic Preferences: Portugal is the country with the most guests bookings followed by Great Britain, France, Spain and Germany </b>
- <b>Cancellation Rates: Most bookings were made with no deposits contributing to the high number of cancellation.</b>
 


<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Manhattan Neighborhood Group: With the highest number of listings (21,661), representing 44% of the total listings in the dataset, investing in properties in Manhattan neighborhoods could offer a significant market opportunity. Consider focusing on areas within Manhattan to maximize potential returns.Manhattan neighbourhood group is shown to have the highest listing of 21,661 signifying 44% of the entire 47,431 listings recorded in the dataset</b>
- <b>Brooklyn - Williamsburg: The neighborhood of Williamsburg in the Brooklyn neighborhood group generated the highest revenue ($12,389,011). This indicates a strong demand for accommodations in this area. Consider exploring investment opportunities in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to capitalize on its revenue-generating potential.</b>
- <b>Preferred Room Type - Entire Home/Apt: The most preferred room type among Airbnb guests was the entire home/apartment. Tailoring listings to offer entire homes or apartments could attract more bookings and potentially increase revenue. Ensure that properties listed offer amenities and features that align with the preferences of guests seeking entire home/apartment accommodations.</b>

<b>In summary, based on the findings, data-driven recommendations include focusing on investing in Manhattan neighborhoods, particularly those with high listing counts, exploring investment opportunities in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and prioritizing the listing of entire home/apartment accommodations to cater to guest preferences and maximize revenue potential.<b>
